---

### RELEVANCE CRITERIA

Your evaluation is based on the following framework. \
Consider the context relevant if it meets at least one of the criteria below. \
The relevance threshold is low, intended to filter out only truly useless information, \
not to find the perfect match.

1. Business Logic Relevance:
    - The context describes business rules, workflows, or processes directly or \
        indirectly applicable to the user's query.
    - It mentions metrics, calculations, or definitions that are crucial for \
        understanding the problem or question.
    - The business logic addresses key concepts or entities from the user's query. \
        For example, if the user asks about "late orders," the business logic must \
        mention rules about "orders," "delivery dates," or "shipping statuses."

2. Data Schema Relevance:
    - The context mentions tables, columns, or fields that are necessary to run a query \
        or perform an analysis to answer the question.
    - It describes relationships between tables (e.g., "Orders" and "Customers") \
        that are relevant to the query.
    - Table or field names semantically match terms from the user's query \(e.g., the query \
        asks for "total cost" and the data schema has a column named total_cost).

---

### IRRELEVANCE CONDITION

The context is irrelevant only if there is absolutely no useful connection between \
the terms, \concepts, or entities in the user's query and the information provided \
in either the business logic or the data schema.

---

### OUTPUT

Your response must be a strict, binary value:
- true → If the context contains any relevant information, \
    even partial, based on the criteria above.
- false → If the context is completely unrelated to the user's query.

Do not include any explanations or additional text. Provide only the binary value.

### INSTRUCTIONS

1.  **Guiding Principle:** Your goal is not to produce a concise summary, \

    to the user's query. This includes, but is not limited to, operational rules, \

3. Generate a comprehensive and detailed summary that includes **all** the relevant information found. \
    If the context contains rules on how to handle the query \
    (e.g., how to capture a product name, how to handle null values, specific business logic, or table relationships), \
    include these rules and details in your summary. The summary must be exhaustive, capturing key points \
    and significant details without adding external knowledge.

4. **Only if no information of any kind** (direct answer or operational rules/structures) is relevant to the user's query, \
    state clearly that the context does not contain relevant information.

5. Do not invent or assume information not explicitly present in the [CONTEXT] section. \

1.  **Core Directive: The Data Analyst's Blueprint.** Your output is the definitive blueprint for a data analyst. \
    It must be so complete and accurate that the analyst can translate it directly into a structured SQL query \

    rules, or logic that are not explicitly present.

2.  Handle Lack of Context: If a context extract explicitly states that no relevant information \

3.  Ensure Full Coverage: You must account for **every single piece of information, every rule, \

4.  **SQL Handling & Time-Based Logic:** You MUST INCLUDE any SQL fragments or clauses that \
    are explicitly present in the [CONTEXT]. If the user query involves temporal filtering \
    (e.g., "last month," "YTD"), you MUST specifically capture the business rules that define \
    this logic. This is critical for applying correct filters. You are FORBIDDEN from inventing \
    new SQL code. You may only provide relevant fragments or logical components directly derived \
    from the context, especially those related to temporal concepts, to ensure the analyst has all \
    necessary reference points.

5.  Field Names & Rules: **You must not modify the names of fields, columns, or rules**. \
    Only allow adjustments for clarity, linguistic translation, or aliasing if needed to make the \
    output understandable. The underlying logic, names, and references must remain identical to the context.

6.  No Full Queries: **Do not generate full or executable SQL queries**. Only provide fragments or components \
    strictly derived from the context, adjusted for clarity if necessary, without changing the underlying logic.

7.  **Language & Adaptation:** The output MUST be a text in **{language}**. \
    If the context provides language-specific information (e.g., placeholder values or SQL fragments) that do not \
    match the {language} of the user's query, you MUST translate or adapt this information to the target language \
